## Write text using your 3D Printer

(Early Alpha version)

This little program can write text using your 3D Printer, using Hardcoded Letters.

It currently only supports capital letters A-Z and space, as this project is Work in Progress.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repo
2. Create a directory called "output" in the projects' directory
3. Set up your 3D printer and measure the distance between your nozzle and the pen's tip
4. Input the values into the respective variables in main.py
5. Run main.py
6. Copy the GCODE to your 3D Printer and execute it

**I currently strongly advise against using it, as this project is still in early alpha and could damage your machines if you do not know what you are doing!**

## Roadmap
- Incorrect New line handling
- Charachter set limitations
- Usability
